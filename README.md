## Overview

Medical costs can vary widely based on numerous factors. This project leverages machine learning to analyze historical patient data and predict medical charges, enabling better financial planning and insights into healthcare costs.

The project is implemented in Python and includes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains patient information, including:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Children (Number of dependents)
- Smoking habits
- Region (Location of the individual)
- Medical Charges (Target variable)

Ensure you have the appropriate dataset in CSV format to run the project. If no dataset is provided, you can use publicly available healthcare datasets from platforms like Kaggle.

## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **EDA:** Visualization of data distributions, correlations, and feature importance.
- **Modeling:** Training and evaluating various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are used to evaluate model performance.

## Models

The following models are explored and evaluated in the project:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Each model's performance is compared to identify the best fit for the dataset.

## Results

Detailed results, including visualizations and performance metrics, are included in the notebook. Key insights and recommendations are summarized for practical implementation.
